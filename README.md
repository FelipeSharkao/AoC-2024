# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions to the Advent of Code 2024. Each solutions hosted independently in its own
directory. I'll try to use different languages throughout this challenge to try this out,
and record how long it took me.

## Days:

- Day 1:

  - Language: C (the puzzle was very easy, so I used a lower level language because solving it in a higher level one wouldn't be any fun).
  - Time spent on the fist puzzle: 2h (I'm rusty on good ol' C)
  - Time spent on the second puzzle: also 2h

- Day 2:

  - Language: Haskell (the best and the worst functional programming language there is)
  - Time spent on the first puzzle: 2h (Haskell documentation is so so bad)
